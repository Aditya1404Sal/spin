//! Loaders for Spin applications.
//! This crate implements the possible application sources for Spin applications,
//! and includes functionality to convert the specific configuration (for example
//! local configuration files or from OCI) into Spin configuration that
//! can be consumed by the Spin execution context.
//!
//! This crate can be extended (or replaced entirely) to support additional loaders,
//! and any implementation that produces a `Application` is compatible
//! with the Spin execution context.
