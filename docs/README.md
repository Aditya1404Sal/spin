# The Spin documentation website

**The Spin documentation website is deprecated.** We still run it, but only to redirect to new documentation.

To build and run the Spin documentation website:

1. Build Spin using the [contributing guide](https://spinframework.dev/contributing-spin).

2. Run the website from this directory via Spin:

```
$ spin up
```

3. View documentation website at http://localhost:3000
